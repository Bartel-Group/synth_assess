## mp_solids_data.json
Materials project data on ground-state experimentally realized materials. If not otherwise specified, this data is used to generate reaction networks (for possible competing reactions). Any alternate user-specified data must be of the same format. This file is in the form 

```
{"clean_formula":{"material_id": str from MP, "formula": clean-format formula string, "energy_per_atom": float, "volume": float, "energy_above_hull": float, "theoretical": Bool (True if the material has no ICSD ID), "formation_energy_per_atom": float, "nsites": int, "tm_precursor": Bool (True if the material is in tm_precursors)}}
```

## tm_precursors.json
A list of all (cleaned) precursors used in text-mined reactions. Unless otherwise specified, these are the precursors used in reaction network generation. The file is of the form
```
{'data':[list of precursor strings]}
```

## tm_rxns_by_chemsys.json
A list of all reactions associated with each chemical space represented in the textmined dataset. This format is most useful as reaction networks are generated by chemical space. Then, individual targets within th chemical space can be identified. This file is of the form 
```
{"A,B,C":[{'rxn':rxn string, 'precursors': [list of precursors used in rxn], 'temperature': float (K), 'atmosphere': str (excluded if oxygen or inert environment), 'doi': str for doi associated with the paper from which the reaction is mined, 'mp': Bool (True if all participating species are in MP)}]}
```
 where 'A,B,C' represents the elements in the chemical space in alphabetical order.

## tm_targets
A list of all (cleaned) targets in text-mined reactions.The file is of the form 
```
{'data':[list of target strings]}
```
