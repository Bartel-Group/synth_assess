# synth_assess.plotting

This module allows users to recreate the figures found in the accompanying paper. The synth_assess.plotting.fig_plotting can be modified by the user, but can be used to 
recreate the paper figures with no additional user inputs as is. For example, to recreate Figure 1, run the following:

```
from synth_assess.plotting.fig_plotting import plot_fig_1

plot_fig_1()
```

Helper functions used in the fig_plotting module can be found in plot_helpers.py.
