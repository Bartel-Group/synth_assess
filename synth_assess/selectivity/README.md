This module enables users to generate reaction networks in order to identify target-forming reactions and to determine their associated selectivity. 
In the synth_assess.selectivity.rxn_metrics module, the GammaFromTarget class aggregates the entire workflow for reaction network construction and gamma computation 
and may be used to identify the most selective reaction to form a target of interest at a specified temperature. For further customization, users may refer to 
synth_assess.selectivity.entries, which is called in the rxn_metrics module.
