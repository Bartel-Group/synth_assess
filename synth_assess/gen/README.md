# synth_assess.gen.gen_materials

This module allows the user to generate new materials in chemical spaces of interest using [Chemeleon](https://github.com/hspark1212/chemeleon.git) and to compute the energies of these materials using [CHGNET](https://github.com/CederGroupHub/chgnet.git). This module was used to generate the materials examined in the accompanying paper.
